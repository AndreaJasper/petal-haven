# Petal Haven

## About the Site
The Petal Haven website emerges as both a sanctuary for revitalizing my HTML and CSS skills and a pioneering venture into the realm of artificial intelligence-driven programming. At its core, this project served as a remarkable avenue for me to revisit and strengthen my command over raw HTML and CSS. However, what truly distinguishes this undertaking is the symbiotic dance between human creativity and AI innovation. Leveraging the potency of AI, I entrusted it with constructing 75% of the foundational elements, witnessing the birth of an intricate web structure. This fusion of technology and artistry not only expedited the development process but also offered invaluable insights into the potential of AI-assisted programming. The remaining 25% of the endeavor involved meticulous handcrafting, where I honed the AI-generated output to align flawlessly with my creative vision. Through this collaborative journey, I embarked on a beginner's exploration of AI's capabilities and its interaction with human input. This experiment enabled me to delve into the nuances of refining AI-generated content, comprehending the nuances of prompts, and uncovering the extent of AI's potential in the programming landscape. The Petal Haven website, as a testament to this endeavor, exemplifies the harmonious convergence of traditional coding prowess and the burgeoning realm of AI-driven programming.
